# Cache Manager Basics

Understand how Arbitrum’s Cache Manager works, why it matters, and how to find it on any network.

## What is the Cache Manager?

The **Cache Manager** is a core smart contract on Arbitrum that lets you reserve high-speed cache slots for your WASM (Stylus) contracts. Caching your contract means:

- Faster execution (no cold-start penalty)
- Lower gas costs for repeated calls
- Predictable performance for demanding dApps

But cache space is limited. To get (and keep) a slot, you must **bid**—and maintain your bid—against others. The Cache Manager enforces these rules and handles slot allocation.

## Where is the Cache Manager?

You interact with the Cache Manager contract directly on-chain. Here’s how to find it:

### RPC Endpoints

| Network          | RPC Endpoint                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Arbitrum One     | https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc           |
| Arbitrum Nova    | https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc           |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc |
| Local (dev/test) | http://localhost:8547                  |

### Get the Cache Manager Address

You can retrieve the contract address for any network using the CLI:

```sh
cargo stylus cache status --endpoint=<RPC_ENDPOINT>
```

#### Known Addresses

| Network          | Cache Manager Address                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Arbitrum One     | 0x51dedbd2f190e0696afbee5e60bfde96d86464ec |
| Arbitrum Nova    | 0x20586f83bf11a7cee0a550c53b9dc9a5887de1b7 |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | 0x0c9043d042ab52cfa8d0207459260040cca54253 |
| Local (default)  | 0x0f1f89aaf1c6fdb7ff9d361e4388f5f3997f12a8 |

## How does it work?

- You place a bid to reserve a cache slot for your contract.
- The Cache Manager tracks all bids and enforces minimums.
- If someone outbids you (by at least 10%), you risk eviction.
- You must keep your bid funded—automation is highly recommended.
