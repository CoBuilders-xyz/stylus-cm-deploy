### **Step 1: Configure Your Notification Channels**

You can choose from the following options:

- **Telegram** â€” Set your Telegram Chat ID and start a conversation with [@stylusCmNotifications_bot](https://t.me/stylusCmNotifications_bot).
- **Slack** â€” Provide a valid Slack Webhook URL.
- **Webhook** â€” Use any compatible Webhook endpoint for custom integrations.

Each channel has a **Test** button to validate the connection before saving.

</figure>

Youâ€™ll see the following alert types:

- **Eviction** â€” Notifies you when your contract is evicted from the cache.
- **No Gas** â€” Alerts you when your gas balance is insufficient for automated bidding.
- **Low Gas** â€” Triggers when your balance drops below a custom threshold.
  â†’ You can set the threshold manually in ETH.
- **Bid Safety** â€” Warns you when the minimum bid approaches your current bid.
  â†’ Use the slider to adjust the sensitivity.

For each alert type, select the channels where you want to receive notifications:

- Telegram
- Slack
- Webhook
