## **⛽ Manage Gas Tank**

The **Gas Tank** holds the ETH balance used for automated bidding transactions.

To deposit funds, open the **Gas Tank** from the navbar.

</figure>

Enter the amount of ETH you want to deposit.
This balance will be used when the automation logic places a bid on your behalf.

Click **Deposit Gas** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

After the transaction is confirmed, your updated balance will be reflected in the Gas Tank.

To withdraw your funds, switch to the Withdraw tab—you can withdraw the full balance at any time.
